## Ottr ACME Client

`ottr-airbnb` is a Python wrapper around `acme.sh` that handles the certificate
signing process for Certificate Authorities that support the ACME protocol such
as Let's Encrypt. This package is utilized for containers running on Ottr that
handle the logic for X.509 certificate rotations.
